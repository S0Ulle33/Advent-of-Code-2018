# My solutions to the Advent of Code 2018

So, I decided to participate in [AOC 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018). My main priorities in solving the task of the day:
* **Do not use third-party modules**
* **Simplicity**
* **Readability** _(e.g., do not write one-liners)_

## Usage

It's pretty simple, although so far without the extra features.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/S0Ulle33/Advent-of-Code-2018.git
cd Advent-of-Code-2018
```
* `python run_all.py` â€” run all solutions.
* `python solution.py` â€” or run individually from `Day n/` folder.
